# Install
The file should be downloaded on the *Downloads* folder
Open a console
```shell
cd ~/Downloads                   ## Go to the download folder
sudo dpkg -iÂ package_file.deb    ## Install
```
# Start the service
We need to start the Nessus service called *nessusd.service* 
We have **two** options, choose one:
1. **Start** the service and **enable** it to autostart after future restarts. (Recommended)
```shell
sudo systemctl enable nessusd.service
```
2. **Start** the service once (You'll need to start manually after every restart)
Use one of this commands
```shell
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service

or

sudo service nessusd.service start
```
# Open
Now, Nessus is installed and also is already running as a server.
As a client, we need to connect to the server through the browser, usually to the `https://127.0.0.1:8834/` or the *URL* showed in the console after installation.
